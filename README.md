# FairShare
FairShare is a web-based tool that lets you fairly split a shared bill and extras among friends. Users can enter the total shared amount, add friends, assign extra items to one or multiple people, and see real-time calculations of base, extras, and total per person. The app allows removing extras or friends and can generate a detailed PDF report. Data is saved in localStorage for persistence, and the UI is responsive and visually styled with modern cards and accent colors.
